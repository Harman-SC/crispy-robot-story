A while ago, there was a girl who had a recurring dream that haunted her for 
years. She tried to seek out help, but she was never able to find the
right person. Her boyfriend, who, if we're being completely honest, was not 
really as into the relationship as her, didn't really like where their
relationship was going. One day, the girl woke up and realized she was 
living that dream.



Finally, the girl found out that she wasn't living the dream out because of
 a key line that her boyfriend said to her as she thought of how to get out of
the dream.
