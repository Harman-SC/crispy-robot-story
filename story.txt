A while ago, there was a girl who had a recurring dream that haunted her for 
years. She tried to seek out help, but she was never able to find the
right person. Her boyfriend, who, if we're being completely honest, was not 
really as into the relationship as her, didn't really like where their
relationship was going. One day, the girl woke up and realized she was 
living that dream.

Finally, the girl found out that she wasn't living the dream out because of
 a key line that her boyfriend said to her as she thought of how to get out of
the dream.

So she decided to break the recurring rules in that dream, she decided to
break up with her bf and go back to live with her parents. Suddenly, she found
everything was going great and things won't happen repeatly until her bf lying
beside her and woke her up.

Eventually she became a master of lucid dreaming. But the problem was only one
thirds solved, and there was no way to affect the waking world. One day, she 
discovered an ancient, forgotten branch of meditation. With enough concentration, 
she became able to manipulate her very senses. At first, she could manipulate 
points of light, but gradually she gained control of smells, sounds, and even images.
She did not heed the many warnings peppered throughout the texts. She was going to 
make everything right.

Finally she convinced herself to get out of the dream by not giving in to 
the tempatation of being trapped in a dream that she could manipulate.

She realized that all of this was really weird and decided to schedule an 
appointment with her therapists since self-care is great. After a few weeks she would like
to report that she is doing great and hasn't had a weird dream since.
