A while ago, there was a girl who had a recurring dream that haunted her for 
years. She tried to seek out help, but she was never able to find the
right person. Her boyfriend, who, if we're being completely honest, was not 
really as into the relationship as her, didn't really like where their
relationship was going. One day, the girl woke up and realized she was 
living that dream.
So she decided to break the recurring rules in that dream, she decided to
break up with her bf and go back to live with her parents. Suddenly, she found
everything was going great and things won't happen repeatly until her bf lying
beside her and woke her up.
